## What to do beforehand

- Remove tape and zip ties from old tournaments
- Ensure your cords are untangled to reach approximately 6 inches between the plugs (and alligator clip)
- Make sure your lames are zipped, right side out, and off the hanger

## Common Problems

- Gloves with ripped seams
  - Solution: Glue or stitch down seams
- Gloves with holes all the way through
  - Solution: Stitch or patch holes (glue is not sufficient)
- Mask not tight against head, elastic won't stretch anymore
  - Solution: Replaced the elastic, or use a safety pin to keep it tight
- Body cord wires being damaged
  - Solution: Have your body cords tested/repaired by a coach or armorer
- Lames not conductive enough
  - Solution: Test your lame with a multimeter, patching with lame material or covering with conductive tape any spots over 10 ohms.
