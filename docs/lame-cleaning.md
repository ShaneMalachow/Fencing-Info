# Lame Cleaning and Care

**Only hand wash.**

1. Fill a wash tub or 5 gallon bucket with tepid water mixed with 1/4 cup mild detergent (e.g. Woolite) and 1/4 cup ammonia (Windex with ammonia can be substituted).

2. Fully soak the lame in the solution for a **minimum** of two hours. **Lightly** scrub the dirty, discolored, or stiff areas with a nylon scrubber or a soft toothbrush.

3. Rinse well with clean, tepid water. Roll up the lame in a towel and blot dry. **Do not wring it out.**

4. Hang right side out to dry and reverse to dry lining if needed.
